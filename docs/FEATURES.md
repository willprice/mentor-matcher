# Mentor
* As a mentor, I can signup, listing my background, skills, and availability, so
  that potential mentees can find me
* As a mentor, I can list how many mentees/time commitment per mentee I am

  unable to fulfil.
* As a mentor, I can review requests for mentoring from mentees, so that I can
  choose to accept or reject mentees
* As a mentor, I would like to receive an email when a candidate mentee has
  requested me as a mentor, so that I can review their profile and deem their
  suitability
* As a mentor, the website will release my contact details to an approved
  mentee, so I can start my mentoring relationship.
* As a mentor, I can confirm that a mentoring relationship has begun, so that my
  availability is appropriately reduced

* As a mentee, I can sign up, listing keywords for skills that I am interested
  in being mentored in, so that the website will show me relevant mentors to
  review.
* As a mentee, I can peruse mentors who's skill sets match my desired mentoring
  topics, so that I can find mentors to mentor me.
